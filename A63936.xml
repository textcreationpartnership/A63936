            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T were, Right Mighty Princes, a thing worthy the moving of the High and Honorable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Parliament, to grant this licence, that all Dukes, Earles, Lords, Barons, Knights, and their right begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonnes, might have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, whenſoever they ſaw any ſtartup which could not ſpend two Hundred pounds a yeare of his own truely gotten lands, wearing ſilke, velvet, or any Golden Chaine to carry this Crowe to the next Market Towne, and there to pull his feathers, that is to cut his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43836:3"/>cloathes all to peeces, &amp; to take his chaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him; and take the one halfe thereof himſelfe, and give the other halfe to the poore of the Towne. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Counteſſe of Eaſt <hi>Freſeland</hi> when ſhe was certified, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Yeamons wife had guarded her gowne with a broad guard of velvet, ſhe ſent her of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers unto her, and cauſed them to cut all her guards in peeces, and condemned her in a great ſome of money for her pride. Mee thinkes you doe very ill to ſuffer every man that liſteth to come into your livery appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, fellowſhip and orders, and refuſe no man whatſoever hee bee. Birds of a feather fly together, beaſts of a kind flocke together, fiſhes of a ſort ſwimme together; onely the Nobility of <hi>England</hi> ſuffer all kindes of men to come into their order and livery. Every company will receive none into their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany but ſuch as are of their company. If a man put a Prieſts cap upon a ſowes head, and a tippet about her neck, and ſet her up againſt a ſtall in <hi>Cheapeſide,</hi> and give her huskes to eate, would not all the whole order of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers bee angry with him that cloathed the ſow ſo. If a man ſhould ſhave an ape in the crowne, and ſet a miter upon his head, and put a rocket upon him, would not the Biſhops be diſpleaſed with him that did ſo? But Oh ye Nobles, doe not ye ſuffer Dicers and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and all kind of vnthrifts, not onely to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43836:3"/>goe in Gentlemens apparrell, but alſo recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve them into your houſes: ye ſuffer alſo a ſort of falſe Apoſtles to take your honour from you, and to be your Lords and Maſters, and to occupy your offices, which ſhould belong onely unto your order and dignity, is not this as it were a kinde of leproſie in your faces to be thus defaced and ſhamed by theſe crafty foxes. Theſe falſe named Biſhops and Prelates become Embaſſadors, or at leaſt beare a great hand in it. Alſo preſidents, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of peace, and ſome full Lordly ſit at Siſes and Seſſions amongſt temporall Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, leaving their owne Courts to ſome ſingle ſir <hi>Iohn,</hi> or to ſome blind Briber, ſometimes they are Councellors of State, Knights of the Garter, yea to be the High Chauncellor of <hi>England,</hi> and preſident of the Councell, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all the Lords. Wee reade in <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> that the Nobility of the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſuffering them to partake with them in their office, in the end became both Prieſts &amp; Kings, and had all the Nobility under their girdle: And thus it is at this day with the Biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> And if you ſaw but how they uſe heare to handle the Clargie in their Convocation Houſe, you would ſay that they were the Popes right ſhapen ſonnes; for whereas their ſitteth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight linnen wearing Biſhops: If there be fortie Paſtors, and Elders that are wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearers, yet in the coldeſt weather, whileſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43836:4"/>they ſtand there before them, they muſt ſtand bareheaded, bee they never ſo old or ſickley. Is this pride to be ſuffered; by this you may ſee how they would handle you, if they could get the upper hand over you; thus was it with the Biſhops of <hi>Menſe,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Wormes,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Collen</hi> came impudently to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, Emperour of that name, &amp; tooke his Crowne from of his head. And <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1260. two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons under the Biſhops, bad the Governour of <hi>Colen</hi> to dinner, and brought him to a faire Chamber, wherein was an hungry Lyon, and ſhut him in; but the Governour whom God preſerved, put his left hand into the Lyons throate, and with the other hand tooke out his dagger &amp; ſlew the Lyon; and within few dayes after hanged up the two Canons (as they well deſerved.) The Biſhop of <hi>Luke Anno Dom.</hi> 1460. would not heare of any mercy though the Citty petitioned for Peace, but he cauſed his coſen <hi>Charles</hi> to kill 40000 men, and to drowne 12000 women in the flood <hi>Moſa.</hi> And in <hi>Jermany,</hi> they made this rime of their Biſhops tyrany:
<q>
                  <l>Monkes, Nunnes, and Papes,</l>
                  <l>Goates, Rats, and Apes;</l>
                  <l>Flies, Catterpillers, and Miſe,</l>
                  <l>Whores, wiveleſſe, and Lice;</l>
                  <l>Where they get the upper hand,</l>
                  <l>They deſtroy both Citty and Land.</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43836:4"/>And it may eaſily be perceived what an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious minde they beare amongſt us, and how they would gladly Raigne over you if they could effect it. The only remedy therfore is to drive theſe idle ambitious Biſhops home to their ſtudies, &amp; to cauſe them to preach Gods Word to the people co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to their charge. To make good and honeſt Civilians, &amp; Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-learned honeſt men; Lawyers &amp; no Prieſts to be Knights, Lords, Councellors, Iuſtices of Peace, Chancellors, &amp;c. And to take your offices upon you, &amp; to doe them your ſelves; But hold in no caſe the Biſhops from their Pulpits, leaſt the vengance of God fall both on you, and them; upon you for holding of them from doing of their duty, upon them for not doing of their duty, if yee drive theſe falſely named Lords and Gentlemen out of your order, and company, &amp; will doe your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and duties in your owne perſons; as Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God would have you to do; then ſhall ye have juſt honour in this world, and in the world to come, life everlaſting.</p>
